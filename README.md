# HelloWorldSwift

## Description

As Playground stability comes and goes, a developer needs a place to try stuff out.

This repository currently handles these concerns only:
- Swift <-> Objective-C interop
- Quick/Nimble
- Kiwi for mocking
- RxSwift

It includes **very** minimal examples of all except the last.

## You May Need

You might need to [install Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) with `sudo gem install cocoapods`.

Then you need to run `pod install`.
